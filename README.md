# **BSS Billing System**

This project implements a basic Billing Support System (BSS) for managing customer data and generating bills for a telecommunication company. It supports loading customer data from a CSV file, saving new customer data to the file, and calculating the bill based on the customerâ€™s service plan, data usage, call minutes, and SMS usage. The system uses Java for backend operations and can be extended for more advanced billing operations.
